<h1>My Projects</h1>

<div class="project">
    <h2>End-to-End Python Pandas Data Analysis App and Dashboard Generator with Streamlit</h2>
    <p>This project showcases the development of an interactive dashboard that leverages the power of Pandas for data analysis and Streamlit for creating an engaging web application. The app allows users to analyze datasets and visualize the results with interactive graphs and charts, making data analysis accessible to non-technical users.</p>
</div>

<div class="project">
    <h2>LLAMA 3.1 ChatBot</h2>
    <p>Building an Interactive Chatbot with LLAMA 3.1, Streamlit, and Python. This chatbot leverages the capabilities of LLAMA 3.1 to provide dynamic and context-aware conversations, offering a sophisticated user interaction experience. The integration with Streamlit enhances the usability and accessibility of the chatbot.</p>
</div>

<div class="project">
    <h2>Groq Streamlit Demo App</h2>
    <p>This project involves building a Streamlit AI chatbot using Groq, the fastest LLM inference API. The app features a menu option that allows users to select different models for inference, demonstrating the flexibility and performance of the Groq API in real-time chatbot interactions.</p>
</div>

<div class="project">
    <h2>Search Engine and Recommendation System</h2>
    <p>This project focuses on creating a simple recommendation system that suggests items to users based on their preferences. Techniques like collaborative filtering and content-based filtering are used to recommend movies, offering personalized suggestions to enhance user experience.</p>
</div>

<div class="project">
    <h2>Sales Prediction - Public</h2>
    <p>Sales prediction involves forecasting the amount of a product that customers will purchase, considering various factors such as advertising expenditure and target audience segmentation. This project aims to build a predictive model that assists businesses in making informed decisions based on predicted sales trends.</p>
</div>

<div class="project">
    <h2>Image Captioning</h2>
    <p>This project combines computer vision and natural language processing to build an AI system that generates captions for images. By using pre-trained image recognition models like VGG or ResNet, the system can extract features from images and generate descriptive captions, bridging the gap between visual and textual information.</p>
</div>

<div class="project">
    <h2>Movie Rating Prediction</h2>
    <p>This project involves building a model that predicts the rating of a movie based on features like genre, director, and actors. Regression techniques are employed to analyze the data and make accurate predictions, helping users discover movies that match their preferences.</p>
</div>

<div class="project">
    <h2>Chat with Dataframe</h2>
    <p>This project showcases a Streamlit chatbot that allows users to interact with a DataFrame using Langchain Agent and Ollama. The chatbot uses Generative AI and LLM technologies to provide insightful responses based on the data, making it a powerful tool for data exploration and analysis.</p>
</div>

<div class="project">
    <h2>Titanic Survival Prediction - Public</h2>
    <p>This project focuses on building a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not using the Titanic dataset. As a classic beginner project, it introduces essential machine learning techniques and concepts, making it a valuable learning experience for newcomers.</p>
</div>

<div class="project">
    <h2>Rule-based Chatbot - Public</h2>
    <p>This project demonstrates how to build a rule-based chatbot using Python. Unlike self-learning bots, this chatbot uses predefined rules to generate responses, making it simpler and easier to control while still offering valuable user interactions.</p>
</div>

<div class="project">
    <h2>Task Manager</h2>
    <p>This project involves the development of an easy-to-use task manager app built in Python. The app helps users organize and manage their tasks efficiently, providing a straightforward interface for task tracking and prioritization.</p>
